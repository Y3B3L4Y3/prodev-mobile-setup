# First Expo Mobile App — prodev-mobile-app-0x00

## Project Setup Steps

1. Navigated to my main repo:

2. Created and entered the task directory:

3. Scaffolding the Expo Router project:
- Selected **Expo Router** template.

4. Moved generated files into `app-example/` as required:

5. Modified `app-example/app/(tabs)/index.tsx`  
Changed the default text **Welcome!** to:
- Scanned the QR code using Expo Go (Android).

The app launched successfully showing **First App Created**.

## Reset Project Observation

Ran:

### What happened:

- Deleted `node_modules`  
- Cleared Expo caches  
- Removed `.expo` temporary folders  
- Reinstalled dependencies  
- Project returned to a clean state, similar to a fresh scaffold  
- All local environment caches were reset

This helps fix broken dependencies and ensures development consistency.
